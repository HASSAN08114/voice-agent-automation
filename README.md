# Voice Agent Automation

This repository contains workflow files for a **Voice Agent** that automates outbound calls, checks calendar availability, and books calls into a CRM system.  
It is designed for use with **n8n** (or other workflow automation platforms that support JSON-based workflows).

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Outbound Caller** – Automates outbound call handling and initiation.
- **Calendar Checker** – Verifies calendar availability before scheduling.
- **CRM Booking** – Logs and manages calls directly in your CRM system.
- **Modular Design** – Each workflow is separate, making it easy to customize or extend.
